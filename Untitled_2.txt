Hi guys,

For a memory game I need to add opened card to a list of "opened" cards and then, if the list already has another card in it, I'd like to check to see if the two cards match.

All my cards have the .card class and unique data-names (which ofc. come in pairs).

So far I have set up an event listener for each card. I would also like my cards to be stored in:
var openedCards = [];


cards.forEach(card => card.addEventListener('click', cardOpen));

Can anyone explain

function cardOpen() {
openedCards.push(this);
console.log(openedCards) 
    var len = openedCards.length;
    if(len === 2){
        moveCounter();
        if(openedCards[0].type === openedCards[1].type){
            matched();
        } else {
            unmatched();
        }
    }
};

function cardOpen() {
openedCards.push(this);
console.log(openedCards) 
    var len = openedCards.length;
    if(len === 2){  //moveCounter function is called only when openedCards.length === 2
        moveCounter();
            if (openedCards[0].innerHTML === openedCards[1].innerHTML){
            cardMatch();
        } else {
            noMatch();
        }
    }
};

function moveCounter() {
    count++;
    if (count <= 2) {
        return true;
    }
    else {
        return false;
    }
}

debugger;

function cardMatch(){
   
}


// description when cards don't match
function noMatch(){
    
}

function moveCounter() {
    count++;
    if (count <= 2) {
        return true;
    }
    else {
        return false;
    }
}

debugger;
